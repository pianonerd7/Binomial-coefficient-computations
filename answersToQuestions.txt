Question 1

The cuserid() is the is a pointer to a string that says what the current user name is. NULL pointer if information cannot be determined. 

The getuid() is the real user ID of the calling process. The real user ID is the ID of the user that invoked the program. The geteuid() is the effective user ID of the calling process. Difference between effective and real UID is that if a program with a set uid bit set is run, the effecitve UID would be the id of the user who owns the file, while the real UID would be the id of the user who ran it.

The getgid() is the real group ID of the calling process. the getegid() is the effective group ID of the calling process. Smiliar to getuid() and geteuid() and how they are similar most of the time, differing only when setgid is used, this also applies to getgid() and getegid().


Question 2
Because the computer executes really quickly, without accumulating some nonzero time values, the time value would be less than microseconds and we wouldn't be able to see any value. By accumulating some nonzero time values, we are adding a constant so that we can see a non zero time value.
